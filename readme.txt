
Application Used: Spyder
Language Used: Python 3.7

Input file: iris.data

Program File: code.py
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps to run the code:

		1. The 9th line in code has a method df = pd.read_csv(). The file path of the iris.data must be copied in between the brackets.
	
	2. Then click on run code. The code first creates the visualization of the data and shows the data as a dataframe. The plots can be viewed in plots tab for reference. 

	3. The code prints the cross-fold validation accuracy, confusion matrix and classification report for 2 to 7 folds. This range can be edited in line no. 100 for loop.

	4. After 7 folds accuracy is printed, the code interacts asking for sepal and petal sizes. Example: Sepal length: 5.1 Sepal_width: 2.7 Petal_length: 1.2 and Petal_width: 0.4
After entering the above sample input, we get the following output,

Given Inputs
Sepal Length: 5.1 Sepal Width: 2.7 Petal Length: 1.2 Petal Width: 0.4 
Flower may be IRIS-SETOSA

	5. Then at the end comes the multivariate regression without calculating the beta-cap value. 


END
